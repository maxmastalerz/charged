*Not in ay specific order*

Next steps:
1. Fix known issues
2. Allow players to carry a flag, and have it returned upon death.
3. Spawn on your teams corner of the map in CTF.
4. First team to capture the flag five times wins. Display flag capture count. Restart lobby when someone wins.
5. Determine how players should get bombs. Currently placing a bomb will despawn it elsewhere on the map, and a player might be stuck without bombs.
6. Determine a goal for free for all. What happens when you lose your lives?
7. Display the players in order from highest score to lowest. Similar to the http://agar.io leaderboard.
8. Ability to jump over walls. How should the player get this ability?
9. Make it easier to kill other players...
10. Make CTF players spawn as different shades of red or blue

Known issues:
1. Menu font not loading properly on first load.
2. CTF Flags can be blown up by bombs.
3. There is no chat spam prevention yet. Protection must be implemented on the server-side.
4. Detection for key emitions that surpass the allowed amount is not perfect. It relies on a timer that may kick a legitimate player.
