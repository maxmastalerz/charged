*Not in ay specific order*

## Next steps:

- Allow players to carry a flag, and have it returned upon death.
- Spawn on your teams corner of the map in CTF.
- First team to capture the flag five times wins. Display flag capture count. Restart lobby when someone wins.
- Determine how players should get bombs. Currently placing a bomb will despawn it elsewhere on the map, and a player might be stuck without bombs.
- Determine a goal for free for all. What happens when you lose your lives?
- Display the players in order from highest score to lowest. Similar to the http://agar.io leaderboard.
- Ability to jump over walls. How should the player get this ability?
- Make it easier to kill other players...
- Make CTF players spawn as different shades of red or blue
- Implement a smart spawning system that is not based fully off chance.

## Things to fix/important things to implement:

- Menu font not loading properly on first load.
- There is no chat spam prevention yet. Protection must be implemented on the server-side.
- Detection for key emitions that surpass the allowed amount is not perfect. It relies on a timer that may kick a legitimate player.
